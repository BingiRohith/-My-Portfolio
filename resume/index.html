                <h2>BINGI ROHITH</h2>
                <p> Hello!My name is Rohith i was an college dropout.Even though i had an excellent percentage in 10th and 12th classes i left my studies because after my 12th i didn't got an computer science based branch in b.tech i got an electrical based branch,i never interested in electrical branch and due to my financial problems it was even became very hard to concentrate on my studies,so in my 3rd year i left my studied and joined a job to help my family financial issues.After some days the job i joined was not suited for me and i thought of joining a computer based course and get a job.I had an hobby of reading or knowing about techy news that helped me and  i got a path that can fullfill my dream job.So i joined SKILL SAFARI full stack web development course in it.The way they helped out was good and their teaching was awesome.They have started from basics and regular assignments made me perfect in the topic,The projects they assigned was very challenging,the assistance they gave was very good.It was a great journey with them.</p>
